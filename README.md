Please feel free to contribute pull requests to add additional support!

## Cloudsmith API Key

The API key is required for the cloudsmith-cli to work.

Obtain the API Key from [Cloudsmith user settings](https://cloudsmith.io/user/settings/api/). You should use a least-privilege account for Continuous Integration.

Add a secret named `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY` and a value of the API Key obtained from cloudsmith. Secrets are maintained in the settings of each repository.

Pass your secret to the Action as seen in the Example usage.

## Examples

The following examples use static files located within `test/fixtures`. When republishing existing packages the `republish` flag must be set to `true`, but is otherwise recommended to not use this since it overwrites (and causes longer publish times).

To pin to a specific release of this Github Action, replace `use: cloudsmith-io/action@master` with the version you require e.g. `uses: cloudsmith-io/action@0.4.0`.
